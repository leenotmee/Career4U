Problem Statement:
In the present-day education system students are given very little exposure to the different
fields of interests to build their career in. With little knowledge about the different careers,
students are in a time crunch and are forced to choose hastily relying on trivial facts like the
salary income or job prospects.
Solution:
A personalized application to understand interests, find passion by asking questions at their
grade level, providing info in the form of trivia or quizzes, and generating a viable list of
career options based on their answers.
